        [About This Website:

        Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. This website is designed to show off the projects that I've made by using python, whether they were for school, or just something that I did because I felt like it. Some questions that visitors might have when on my site are: how long ago did you start learning python, why did you start learning python, do you feel confident about writing code using python, and do you know other programming languages besides python. The majority of these questions will be answered in the "FAQ" section. The majority of the content on this site is python code. The user will click on one of the titles that they wish to view, and a download of the file will automatically start. They can they open the file and view it in VSCode or a program like that to view and run the code.
      
      About Me:
    
        My name is Michael Hyer, and I am 21 years old. I work part-time as a server at a Mexican restaurant, while also being a student. I manage to balance the two, though it takes some work at times. I'm known for my sense of humor, as well as my hard-working nature. I first started learning the python language in high school when I took a class on it. I didn't really pay attention to the class, so I barely managed to pass. I am now learning python again, this time in college at BYU-Idaho online. This time I'm paying attention. I have already gone through the first python course, and am currently attending the second. This one is more focused on functions. I wouldn't call myself a master programmer yet, but as I keep going through the python courses, I am sure that I will be able to live up to others' expectations, as well as my own. 
    
      Frequently Asked Questions:
    
        Q. How long ago did you start learning python?
        A. I technically started learning in high school, though I didn't start actually learning until college.
    
        Q. Why did you start learning python?
        A. I started learning python because I heard that it was fairly beginner friendly and easy to understand.
    
        Q. Do you feel confident about writing code using python?
        A. I am fairly confident about my abilities in python, though anything more than the basics is beyond me at the moment.
    
        Q. Do you know other programming languages besides python?
        A. I know a decent amount of HTML and CSS, as you can see by this website. I will continue to learn more programming languages, though.

Still, these are the ones that I am particularly proud of, for one reason or another.
