    <h2>Michael Hyer</h2>
    <h2>Big Mike</h2>
    <p>Hey all, my name is Michael Hyer. I'm 21 years old, and I'm going for the software development degree. I hope to someday become a 
        video game developer.</p>
    <p>There's not a lot to talk about concerning myself, but I'll do my best. I currently work as a server at a Mexican restaurant in Utah. I work
         pretty often, but I've been able to do all my course work so far. I have a cat named Shadow, who is the love of my life (even if she hurts me sometimes). That's about it. </p>
    <p>I look forward to working with you all!</p>
